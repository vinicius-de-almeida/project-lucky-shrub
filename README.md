## 🪴 Lucky Shrub Garden Design: Responsive Website Implementation

This project is the corporate and fully responsive website for the fictional company "Lucky Shrub." It showcases proficiency in fundamental web technologies and best practices.

## ✨ Key Technical Highlights

The implementation focuses on core Front-End standards, enhancing user experience and site maintainability:

Semantic HTML5 & Accessibility (A11Y): Clean, structured markup including fully built and validated forms.

SCSS (Sass) & Responsive Design:

Styles are built using SCSS for modularity and maintainability (variables, component-based structure).

Mobile-First approach utilizing Media Queries and Flexbox for adaptive layouts, including columns and visual features like banners.

Includes minor UI enhancements (light button animations, Gradient).

JavaScript (ES6+) Functionality:

Persistent Dark Mode: Implemented a theme toggle that uses Local Storage to save and maintain the user's preference across sessions.

Client-Side Form Validation: Includes logic to validate form inputs, specifically checking for the @ symbol in email fields before submission.

Objective: To deliver a professional, accessible, and high-performance Front-End solution using core web technologies.
